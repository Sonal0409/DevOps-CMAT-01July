User creation in AWS and create accesskey and secret key for it.

We will use this accesskey and secret key in the terraform configuration file.


You will be connected to AWS management:

In the search box, give IAM and select it.
You will be on IAM dashboard

On the left side→ click on Users→ Click on ADD user button →under user details give User name as Terraform → click on next →select 3rd option Attach policies directly →scroll down and from list click on AdministratorAccess →Scroll down → click next → scroll down and click on Create User.

Configure AWS CLI on the lab machine, and save the access key and secret key on the lab


# aws configure

Give the valid access key

Give the valid secret key

Press enter, no need to give any region and format option
To verify if the credentials have been set for aws

# cat ~/.aws/credentials


=========================================
# mkdir terraformfiles

# cd terraformfiles

# vim aws-infra.tf

provider "aws" {

region = "us-east-1"
shared_credentials_files = ["~/.aws/credentials"]

}


Save the file.

# terraform init

The above command will download aws terraform plugin that will be used to connect to AWS and create Infrastructure.


=====================================

Create s3 bucket resource
=====================================

vim aws-infra.tf

provider "aws" {

region = "us-east-1"
shared_credentials_files = ["~/.aws/credentials"]

}

resource "aws_s3_bucket" "mys3" {
  bucket = "mybucket3456356"

  tags = {
    Name        = "My bucket 1"
   
  }
}


# terraform apply --auto-approve

==============================================
Data Block:
==============================================

Just add this block to exisitng code

# vim aws-infra.tf

data "aws_ami" "myami"{

most_recent = true

owners = ["amazon"]

filter {
    name   = "name"
    values = ["amzn2-ami-hvm*"]
  }

}  

Save the file

# terraform apply --auto-approve

Data Block:
# this is like a query block, that will fetch ami id based on your filter input
Data Block is like a filter which is used to filter values on AWS and fetch it on the terraform machine so that terraform can use them in creating the resource

The data block will not create anything on AWS. it just fetches data for terraform

The data block will fetch the ami id -> based on the filters that I give
We will then use that ami id
